# Voice-Gender-Recognition-Using-Neural-Networks
The project involves developing a machine learning model to accurately classify the gender of a speaker based on voice features. Utilizing a dataset containing various voice characteristics, the project aims to preprocess the data, train a neural network, and evaluate its performance in recognizing gender.
This project focuses on building a neural network model to classify the gender of speakers based on their voice. The steps involved include:

Data Collection: Using a dataset of voice recordings with labeled gender.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features for model training.
Model Training: Developing and training a neural network using the processed data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance using metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.
Visualization: Presenting data correlations and model performance through visualizations
